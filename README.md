# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.


## Describe the steps you took to dig into this codebase. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

- Examined the errors properly by:
  - First, read the output of the error
  - Second, traced the error to its file and line
  - Third, rexamined the error from first step, and checked the code
  - Fourth, these steps were subjective to the error but I troubleshooted the code in where I saw the error occuring.

## What was hard about working with code you did not write?

- We all think differently, therefor logicly our code differs as well. This meant that the code someone else wrote was different than mine, so I had to look at it from the perspective of what would be proper ruby code which is not easy when you're new to Ruby.

## What was easier than you expected about jumping into an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

- What made it easy are the foundations. Code is based on logic, and if you can trail the chaining of logic effectively, then you can pick out the error quicker.
